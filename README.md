# CENIT Developer Days 2021

## Overview

Welcome to the CENIT Developer Days 2021, an event that will take place online this year. For this we have generated a virtual world in the 16bit style of video games of the 80s/90s.

## System Requirements

* To use the virtual world you must use Microsoft's Edge browser (at least version 88.0.705.68).
* Furthermore, you should allow access to your microphone and camera when logging in.
* It is especially important that you disconnect your VPN connection to CENIT.
